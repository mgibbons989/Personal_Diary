# Personal_Diary
This is my Personal Diary Code!

This creates a folder saved to the current directory and creates files (entries) to the folder with the number to keep track.

The code allows the user to type in the terminal and write to the entry.

It also adds today's date to the top of the entry and creates the start: 'Dear Diary, '

This is a beginner program and I hope to develop it into something more visually appealing as I learn more about tech!
